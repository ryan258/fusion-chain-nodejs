# Extended Fusion Chain Types

This document outlines additional chain types to be considered for implementation in the Fusion Chain suite. Each chain type is described with its purpose and potential use cases.

## 1. ConditionalChain

**Purpose:** Allows for branching logic within a chain based on the output of previous steps or external conditions.

**Use cases:**
- Implementing decision trees in conversational AI
- Adaptive content generation based on user preferences or context
- Workflow management with conditional processing steps

## 2. PipelineChain

**Purpose:** Enables a linear sequence of operations where the output of each step becomes the input of the next.

**Use cases:**
- Multi-stage data processing workflows
- Incremental text transformation (e.g., clean -> translate -> summarize)
- Sequential model application (e.g., NER -> sentiment analysis -> classification)

## 3. AggregatorChain

**Purpose:** Collects and combines outputs from multiple parallel chains or operations.

**Use cases:**
- Summarizing information from multiple sources
- Creating ensemble model predictions
- Consolidating results from different analysis methods

## 4. IterativeChain

**Purpose:** Repeats a set of operations until a specific condition is met.

**Use cases:**
- Refining an output until it reaches a certain quality threshold
- Implementing convergence-based algorithms
- Gradual text expansion or reduction

## 5. ClassificationChain

**Purpose:** Specializes in categorizing inputs into predefined classes using one or more models.

**Use cases:**
- Content moderation
- Sentiment analysis
- Topic classification
- Multi-label classification tasks

## 6. RankingChain

**Purpose:** Orders a set of inputs or outputs based on specific criteria.

**Use cases:**
- Search result ranking
- Prioritizing content recommendations
- Sorting alternatives in decision-making processes

## 7. TransformerChain

**Purpose:** Applies a series of predefined transformations to the input or output data.

**Use cases:**
- Text normalization
- Data format conversion
- Feature engineering for machine learning pipelines

## 8. MemoryChain

**Purpose:** Maintains and updates a context or memory state across multiple interactions.

**Use cases:**
- Implementing stateful chatbots
- Maintaining context in long-running processes
- Managing user session data in interactive applications

## 9. AsyncChain

**Purpose:** Manages asynchronous operations and callbacks within a workflow.

**Use cases:**
- Handling long-running processes
- Integrating with external APIs with varying response times
- Managing parallel subtasks within a larger workflow

## 10. ErrorHandlingChain

**Purpose:** Implements sophisticated error handling and recovery strategies.

**Use cases:**
- Creating fault-tolerant AI workflows
- Implementing retry mechanisms for unreliable services
- Graceful degradation in production systems

## 11. MonitoringChain

**Purpose:** Tracks performance metrics, usage statistics, and other KPIs throughout the chain execution.

**Use cases:**
- Implementing observability in production AI systems
- Performance profiling of complex workflows
- Usage analytics for AI services

## 12. OptimizationChain

**Purpose:** Dynamically adjusts chain parameters or model choices to optimize for specific metrics.

**Use cases:**
- Automated hyperparameter tuning
- Model selection in production environments
- A/B testing of AI workflow variants

## 13. ExplainabilityChain

**Purpose:** Generates explanations or interpretations for the outputs of AI models in the chain.

**Use cases:**
- Creating transparent AI systems
- Providing rationale for AI-driven decisions
- Debugging complex model behaviors

## 14. FeedbackChain

**Purpose:** Incorporates user feedback or ground truth data to improve the chain's performance over time.

**Use cases:**
- Implementing active learning
- Continuous improvement in AI systems
- Personalization based on user interactions

## 15. VersioningChain

**Purpose:** Manages different versions of models or chain configurations, allowing for easy rollback or A/B testing.

**Use cases:**
- Safely deploying and testing new models
- Managing multiple chain configurations
- Implementing blue-green deployments for AI workflows

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing these new chain types:

1. Define clear interfaces that allow seamless integration with existing chain types (MinimalChainable, FusionChain, RecursiveChain).
2. Implement each chain type as a separate class with well-documented methods and properties.
3. Create comprehensive unit tests for each new chain type.
4. Update the project documentation and handbook to include these new chain types, along with examples and use cases.
5. Consider creating a visualization tool that can represent complex chain combinations graphically.
6. Ensure that these new chain types can be easily composed and combined with existing types to create complex workflows.
7. Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms for each chain type.
8. Consider performance implications, especially for chains that may involve heavy computational loads or external API calls.

As these chain types are implemented, this document should be updated to reflect any changes in design or additional use cases discovered during development.
