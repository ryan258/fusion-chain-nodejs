## 🧠 How It Works

Our Kid-Friendly AI Storyteller uses a series of AI-powered steps to create a story:

1. **Story Idea Generation**: The AI comes up with a unique story premise.
2. **Character Creation**: Two main characters are created for the story.
3. **Plot Development**: An exciting event is added to the middle of the story.
4. **Story Conclusion**: The AI wraps up the story with a satisfying ending.

The storyteller uses a `PipelineChain` to sequence these steps, ensuring each part of the story builds on the previous ones.

## 🛠️ For Developers

The main components of the storyteller are:

- `KidFriendlyStoryteller` class: The main class that orchestrates the storytelling process.
- `PipelineChain`: A utility class that sequences the story generation steps.
- `OllamaProvider`: The AI model provider used for generating story content.
